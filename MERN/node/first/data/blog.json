            "content": "Neural networks are a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence and machine learning. They are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and are capable of learning complex patterns from data. In this blog post, we'll introduce the basic architecture of neural networks, including neurons, layers, and activation functions. We'll also discuss common types of neural networks, such as feedforward and recurrent networks, and provide examples of real-world applications."
